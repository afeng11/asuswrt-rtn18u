  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Implement option to prevent Firefox's automatic usage of DoH.
         By default, this will only apply if you have DNSPrivacy
         enabled, or if you have DNSFilter enabled with a global
         filter, to ensure that Firefox will not bypass either of
         these.  You can also have this override applied all the
         time, or completely disable it.
