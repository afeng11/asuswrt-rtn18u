  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added stub and stub-v2 compression options to OpenVPN
         clients.  Not added to server, since compression is
         considered deprecated, and will be removed most likely
         in OpenVPN 2.6, for security reasons.
  - NEW: Added tls-crypt-v2 support to OpenVPN clients.
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_39179 (beta GPL from Asus).
  - UPDATED: Openssl to 1.1.1h.
  - UPDATED: Updated to OpenVPN 2.5.0 RC3.  Note that OpenVPN
             2.4.0 or newer is now required by the exported
             client config file.
  - UPDATED: nano to 5.2.
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.72.0.

384.18
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 384_81992 from asuswrt-merlin (mainline).
  - UPDATED: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_52288
  - NEW: Added captcha feature support.
  - CHANGED: Removed switchable protectionSrv feature introduced in
             384.12 and use GPL 382_52288 (closed source) insteaded.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added support for static routes for PPTP/L2TP VPN
         clients, on the Static Route page (themiron)
  - NEW: Added notification when JFFS free space drops
         below 3 MB.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.82-openssl (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Rewrote a large portion of the OpenVPN implementation,
             to make the code easier to maintain.  The new libovpn
             code is released under a GPL licence.  Functionality
             should largely remain the same.
  - CHANGED: Replaced updown-*.sh OpenVPN event handler scripts
             with binary libovpn functions. The new code does
             stricter validation of the configuration.
  - CHANGED: Enabling Client Config Dir (ccd) for an OpenVPN
             server in non-exclusive mode will no longer accept
             duplicate common names (to prevent issues with
             two clients trying to share the same settings).
             If you need such an unusual setup, you should
             enable "Username/Password auth only", which will
             make the common name become the username.  Or
             better, ensure that you have unique certificates
             for all of your users.
  - CHANGED: Removed the (undocumented) vpn_debug setting.  Debug
             logging will now only come from OpenVPN itself
             (configurable through the log verbosity setting).
  - CHANGED: Improved mechanism for providing an available
             mount point for addon API scripters (dave14305)
  - CHANGED: Harmonized the various SSL certificate modes with
             upstream.
             0-None - will be self-generated
             1-Imported - lets you upload your own (no longer
                           self generated unless you don't
                           upload one)
            2-Let's Encrypt (unchanged)
            Self-generated cert will be stored to /jffs/cert.tgz,
            just like upstream.
  - FIXED: ddns updates and OpenVPN instances might be launched
           twice at boot time if the initial ntp clock sync
           happened too fast.
  - FIXED: Enforced DNS and tQoS fix would be lost when the
           firewall gets restarted while an OpenVPN client
           is running.
  - FIXED: Various issues surrounding error state report
           when an OpenVPN client failed to start properly.
  - FIXED: WINS provided by an OpenVPN server weren't properly
           used.
  - FIXED: Some large DNS queries could fail when using DoT
           (patch backported from upstream)

             is NOT backward compatible with previous firmwares)
  - FIXED: ssh/scp client would fail to connect while negotiating
           a chacha20 connection (themiron)

             clients together and identify which guest instance
             they are connected to.
  - CHANGED: Added down/upload monitor to network status page, and
             removed useless RAM chart to free some space.
  - CHANGED: Security hardening in dropbear dropped CBC and 3DES
             ciphers, removed version disclosure from ident
             string (themiron)
  - FIXED: Disks with a single quote in their name would fail to

384.14
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 385_10002 from asuswrt-merlin.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: wan-event script.  The first parameter will be the WAN unit
         (0 for first WAN, 1 for secondary).  The second parameter
         will be a string describing the type of event (init,
         connected, etc...).  A wan-event of type "connected" will
         be identical to when the original wan-start script was
         being run (wan-start should be considered deprecated
         and will be removed in a future release)
  - NEW: Implemented an official API for addon developers to
         better integrate with the router.  This includes up
         to ten different pages that can be added anywhere within
         the webui, and a dedicated storage repository for your
         settings, which can be interacted with through your
         custom web page or through a shell script.
         See the Wiki for more information:

         https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Addons-API

  - NEW: amtm (Asuswrt-Merlin Terminal Menu) by thelonelycoder has
         been added to the firmware.  Running "amtm" over SSH will
         give you a menu allowing you to select and install various
         addons, such as Diversion (ad blocker) or SKynet (an
         advanced firewall extension).  The plugins for amtm are
         still maintained by its original author (thelonelycoder).

         https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/AMTM

  - UPDATED: Backported some fixes from 384_81981, mostly related
             to WAN, port bonding and mdns.
  - UPDATED: odhcp6c to 1.1-97-ge199804 (themiron)
  - UPDATED: curl to 7.67.0.
  - UPDATED: openssl-1.0 to 1.0.2u
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.80-114-ge40d8be (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Replaced entware-setup.sh script with link to amtm, as
             using the amtm Entware installer is now the supported
             method.
  - CHANGED: Improved connection handling in httpd (themiron)
  - FIXED: Some of the newest DNSFilter servers weren't properly set
           up with IPv6 (dave14305)


384.13_1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - FIXED: LED stealth mode always resets to disable after reboot.
  - FIXED: Invalid apply button on Guest Network page.
  - FIXED: Issues on QoS_EZQoS page once QoS activated:
           - Download/Upload Bandwidth fields are blank.

             the selection box.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - FIXED: Missing cifs kernel module
  - FIXED: stubby was linked with OpenSSL 1.0 instead of 1.1
  - FIXED: some routers were reporting the Internet connection being
           disconnected.  If you were affected and you had flashed
           a customized bootloader, then please reflash your original
           bootloader, as your modded bootloader is invalid, and other
           potential issues may appear over time.
  - FIXED: Random traffic spikes logged in Traffic Monitor (regression
           from 384_81351)


384.13
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_81351 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: Allow switching LED stealth mode with WPS button.
         To enable this feature, change the WPS button function on
         System page.
  - NEW: Implement option to switch the logging protocol for
         rsyslog feature. The logging protocol is UDP by default and
         can switch to TCP on General Log page.
  - REMOVED: Unused Main_AdmStatus_Content page
  - REMOVED: Strongswan IPsec VPN feature support.
             It sometimes causes the router crash reboot when using

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Implement option to prevent Firefox's automatic usage of DoH.
         By default, this will only apply if you have DNSPrivacy
         enabled, or if you have DNSFilter enabled with a global
         filter, to ensure that Firefox will not bypass either of
         these.  You can also have this override applied all the
         time, or completely disable it.
  - NEW: Added "split" busybox applet.
  - NEW: Added IPv6 support to Network Analysis webui
  - NOTE: You might need to reconfigure your device hostname on the
          LAN -> LAN IP page due to a GPL-level change.

  - FIXED: Webui wouldn't notify when running dangerously low on
           free nvram (feature was lost at some point in the past)
  - FIXED: Custom clientlist would be wiped if stopping an
           OpenVPN server instance.
  - FIXED: Incorrect detection of EUI64 addresses on the IPv6
           firewall (would prevent using ::/0 for instance).
  - FIXED: EUI64 support missing while in Load Balancing or
           using Multicast IPTV.
  - FIXED: Asus DDNS failing to update due to an invalid
           certificate on Asus's server.

  - UPDATED: Curl 7.65.3.
  - CHANGED: dhcp_staticlist no longer contains hostnames, these
             have been moved to dhcp_hostnames for better
             compatibility with upstream and closed source
             components, also allows more static leases to be
             defined before reaching the size limit.
  - CHANGED: Replace Nettle with OpenSSL for dnsmasq's DNSSEC
             validation, which opens the door to supporting
             more ciphers.  (themiron)
  - FIXED: Firmware Update check button would redirect to Asus
           support site if scheduled checks are disabled.
  - FIXED: IGMP Snooper daemon crashing when more than 32 hosts
           are present (themiron)

384.11
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_51634
  - REMOVED: Unsupported erp_monitor code

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: The project now has its own domain name.  Official website
          is now https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/ and my email address
          for anything related to the project is now
          merlin@asuswrt-merlin.net.

  - NEW: Added WS-Discovery support.  This allows Windows clients
         to detect the router's shared USB drives even if SMBv1
         support is disabled.
  - NEW: Re-added option to extend the WAN's TTL (from stock
         firmware, was previously disabled as it used to
         be broken)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 384_45717
  - UPDATED: Nano 4.2.
  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-11 to 1.1.1c.
  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-10 to 1.0.2s.
  - UPDATED: curl 7.65.1.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd 20190604.
  - CHANGED: Local clients will be shown by their hostname
             on the Classification page.
  - CHANGED: Reworked handling of up/down events in OpenVPN.
             Server instance will now also use its own
             updown script, which will handle firing up
             openvpn-event (if present).
  - CHANGED: Inbound traffic sent to you through an OpenVPN client
             will now be dropped by default.  This can be changed
             through the new "Inbound Firewall" parameter found
             on the OpenVPN client page.  You should only change
             this to "Allow" if running a site2site tunnel with
             a trusted remote server, or if you do expect
             traffic to be forwarded to you through the tunnel.
  - CHANGED: The router will now use ISP-provided resolvers
             instead of local dnsmasq when attempting to
             resolve addresses, for improved reliability.
             This reproduces how stock firmware behaves.
             This only affects name resolution done
             by the router itself, not by the LAN clients.
             The behaviour can still be changed on the
             Administration -> Other Settings page.
  - CHANGED: Randomize the serial number of certificates
             generated by the router for its httpd.  If
             using a router-generated certificate, then
             it's recommended to generate a new one.
  - CHANGED: Allow USB idle values up to 9999.
  - CHANGED: Reworked how some services are started when the WAN
             interface comes up to prevent deadlocks between
             the WAN completing its initialisation, and the
             clock getting set.  These could result is fairly
             long boot time for some ISPs.
  - FIXED: openvpn-event script not launching if the
           client was configured in Secret Key auth
           mode.
  - FIXED: Page redirection failing to apply at boot
           time if WAN was down.
  - FIXED: CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478 and
           CVE-2019-11479 (themiron)


384.10
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_45713 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: rstats: enable BCM530X0-based traffic monitoring.
         The missing code is taken from RT-N18U GPL 378_8041
  - CHANGED: Moved online upgrade option to firmware upgrade page
  - CHANGED: Review the logic of new firmware version check feature
             - Do not associate the online upgrade option with
               the schedule check option
             - Allow check firmware from server instead of opening
               product page when the schedule check option disabled
             - Reset the new firmware notification status when
               'check for new beta firmware' option is changed
             - Do not run the javascript code when its option state
               is not changed
  - CHANGED: Show available stable/beta firmware version within
             the new firmware notification popup.
  - CHANGED: Do not reboot the router when the wireless tx power is
             changed.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added OpenSSL 1.1.1b in parallel to 1.0.2.  Some services
         like AiCloud are still linked against 1.0.2 because they
         would require Asus to recompile them against 1.1.1.

         Main services that currently use OpenSSL 1.1.1:
         httpd (webui), OpenVPN, wget, net-snmp, Tor, inadyn,
         vsftpd, avahi.

         Models that lack AES acceleration will prioritize the use
         of CHACHA20 over AES-256-GCM, for a small performance
         improvement (for instance with the webui).

         Note that OpenVPN 2.4.7's support is still limited.
         TLS 1.3 is supported, but CHACHA20 support is
         only expected with OpenVPN 2.5.0.

         The 1.0.2 userspace tool is still named "openssl", while
         the 1.1.x version is named "openssl11".

  - NEW: Added DNS Privacy feature, with support for
         DNS-over-TLS (also known as DoT).
         You can configure it on the WAN -> Internet Connection
         page.  You can manually add your own servers, or chose
         one (or a few) from the preset list.  (themiron)
  - NEW: NTP daemon on the router, to allow your LAN clients to
         synchronize their clocks with it.
  - NEW: Option to intercept NTP requests from clients, and
         redirect them to the router's own NTP daemon.
  - NEW: Added service-event-end custom script, executed at the
         end of an rc service call.  Receives the same arguments
         as service-event, but is a non-blocking script.
  - NEW: Added sqlite3 CLI command, to allow script authors to
         create/manage their own sqlite3 database
  - NEW: Implemented source/destination IP filtering
         for the Netool version of Netstat web page.
  - UPDATED: Nano 4.0.
  - UPDATED: Curl 7.64.1.
  - UPDATED: Dropbear 2019.78.
  - CHANGED: Replaced the custom ntpclient with a proper ntpd
             implementation, for reduced memory usage and
             increased accuracy.
  - CHANGED: Made the secondary NTP server configurable through the
             webui.  Note that ntpd will use both servers, so clear
             the second server if there is one and you don't want
             to use it.
  - CHANGED: Re-designed firmware upgrade page, moving the schedule
             option to that page.
  - CHANGED: Removed popup messages showing on the DDNS page when
             a service state change was detected.  Report it within
             the page instead.
  - CHANGED: Report firmware version within the new firmware
             notification popup that appears at the top of the webui.
  - CHANGED: Moved LED control (formerly known as Stealth Mode) to
             the System page.
  - CHANGED: Allow URLs up to 64 chars long on the URL filter.
  - CHANGED: pre-mount user script now receives the filesystem
             as second argument.
  - CHANGED: Moved various DNS-related settings from the DHCP page
             to a more appropriate location on the WAN page.
  - CHANGED: OpenSSL default dir moved to /etc/ssl/.  Allows
             programs to automatically locate the CA bundle
             without requiring explicit configuration.
  - CHANGED: Optimized service restarts generated by the
             System page.
  - CHANGED: Replaced Network Analysis and Netstat pages (under
             Network Tools) with new versions based on Asus's
             Netool daemon (RT-AC86U, RT-N18U)
  - CHANGED: Backported multiple fixes and improvements
             for ntpd from upstream, improving handling
             of failed server hostname resolution, and better
             clock sync discipline.
  - FIXED: CVE-2019-1543 issue with Chacha20-poly1305 in
           OpenSSL 1.1 (themiron)
  - FIXED: Client count on the Sysinfo page was missing
           Guest clients
  - FIXED: Miniupnpd sometimes sending ssdp notifies to
           the wrong interface (themiron)

  - CHANGED: Do not restart whole network whenever changing an IP
             reservation on the Networkmap card.
  - FIXED: Reboot scheduler would sometime get stuck, or corrupt
           plugged USB drives.  Now doing a more thorough
           shutdown of services, should hopefully make it
           more reliable.


384.9
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The firmware version is not direct mapping to official
          Asuswrt-Merlin release starting from now since there are
          no available prebuilt binary and no more new features
          introduced for this model in recent codebase.

  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_45149 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: Show the CPU/Wireless temperature in home page.
  - CHANGED: Merge asuswrt-merlin's Tools menu into existing menu:
             - Tools_Sysinfo.asp moved into 'System Log' menu
             - Tools_OtherSettings.asp moved into
               'Administration' menu
  - CHANGED: Update the translation in the wireless site survey
             page.
  - CHANGED: Do not automatically scan site (also disable
             the rescan button) in the wireless site survey page
             when the radio is not enabled.
  - FIXED: The notification flashing interval is not reset after
           checked the firmware update.
  - REMOVED: Temperature page since it's integrated into
             the home page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Report the number of spatial streams and the PHY type
         used by wireless clients for models supporting it
  - NEW: Display tracked connections on the QoS Stats page (now
         relabeled "Classification").
         Fields can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.
         Thanks to FreshJr for his help in deciphering the packet
         mark values.
  - NEW: Implemented lcp-ident option in PPP (required by some ISPs)
         (Themiron).
  - NEW: You can now choose between having your router do internal
         DNS queries locally (through dnsmasq) or with your WAN
         configured DNS (like stock firmware).  This does not
         affect DNS lookups from your clients, only those made
         by the router itself.  The option is under
         Administration -> Other Settings.  (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.20.
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.2.

             .ovpn config file.
  - CHANGED: No longer accept any server-provided route
             when OpenVPN client set to Policy (Strict).
  - CHANGED: Clients bound to DNSFilter rules will no longer
             bypass it by using DoT.  DNSFilter servers that
             support DoT (like Quad9) will only allow filtered
             clients to use that server
  - CHANGED: Re-worked the Classification page.  New design
             is much faster, allows filtering, and shows
             additional info when hovering on a field.
  - CHANGED: Reworked DNS WAN probe implementation (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Increased OpenVPN interface queue length from 100
             to 1000 bytes, to reduce the amount of dropped

           (broken quagga configuration)
  - FIXED: Missing tooltip content for the new local DNS
           resolution setting on the Tweak page
  - FIXED: OpenVPN CA would be overwritten if there was no
           server key or cert present - only generate them
           if all three are missing.
  - FIXED: Bandwidth Limiter not working properly in some
           cases, as it failed to disable hardware acceleration
  - REMOVED: CFB and OFB ciphers from OpenVPN client


384.8_3
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - CHANGED: Update webui translations from GPL 384_45149
  - CHANGED: Review the logic of online firmware update feature:
             The beta release will be used only if it's newer than
             the latest stable and the checking beta option is
             enabled.
  - FIXED: The sysinfo page now can show 'jffs2' in feature field.
  - FIXED: Some wrong help descriptions in QoS page

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:

           clients


384.8_2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - CHANGED: Do not alternate between customized ntp server (from
             webui) and built-in list - only use built-in list if
             the ntp server is not customized.
  - FIXED: Ntpclient command storm happened when no any
           network time is available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 20181205.
  - CHANGED: Push LAN domain to OpenVPN clients as DNS suffix
             for the connection.
  - FIXED: Cannot save custom settings on OpenVPN server page
           on non-HND models.
  - FIXED: Some webui pages fail to load properly in French

           configured (themiron)
  - FIXED: Persistent SSL cert was wiped at boot time in
           some specific scenarios.


384.8
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The IPTV profile data have been moved into binary blobs
          but Asus hasn't released any updated for this model.

  - NEW: Added "extend" support to SNMP.
  - NEW: Added CleanBrowsing to DNSFilter supported services.
  - NEW: Webui HTTP LAN port can now be changed from the default 80.
  - NEW: Added support for the Netfilter TEE target.
  - CHANGED: Removed watchdog from OpenVPN clients, to avoid
             conflicting with more advanced configurations.
  - CHANGED: Vsftpd TLS mode will now reuse the web server
             certificate (including any Let's Encrypt generated
             one).
  - CHANGED: SSL crypto/cipher hardening for httpd (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Syslog will now ignore bwdpi debug output (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Reworked Wireless Log page, adding a new button to
             view low-level details (what stock firmware shows
             on its Wireless Log page), and removed redundant
             option to display DFS channel details.
  - CHANGED: Update dnsmasq to 2.80-11-g59e4703 (themiron)

  - FIXED: Cannot change image for device with a vendor name
           containing an apostrophe (like Micro-Star int'l)
           (Asus bug)
  - FIXED: OpenVPN client download was capped by Adaptive QOS
           upload limit (fix devised by FreshJR)


384.7_2

384.7
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: Important changes to DDNS, please read below.

  - NOTE: Important changes to DNSFilter, please read below.

  - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_21152.
  - NEW: Replaced old ez-ipupdate DDNS client with In-a-Dyn.
         A plugin was developed to fully support Asus's DDNS
         service.
         Custom services can now be configured through ddns-start,
         inadyn.conf, inadyn.conf.add or inadyn.postconf.  See the
         In-a-Dyn documentation as many custom services can be
         defined for it.
  - NEW: Added support for freedns.afraid.org DDNS service to webui.
  - NEW: Added option to retrieve WAN IP from either the local
         interface (like before) or through a remote server
         (which works through double NAT) for DDNS.
  - NEW: Added option to disable checks on unsigned DNSSEC replies.
         Disabling these will speed up lookups, but it will also
         remove part of the security benefits of DNSSEC, so it
         should not be used unless you have a very specific reason
         to do so.
  - NEW: Added Quad9 to DNSFilter supported services.
  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.61.1.
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.19.5.
  - CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2p.
  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to v2.80test8 (themiron).
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.1.
  - CHANGED: All DDNS services now use HTTPS.
  - CHANGED: Replaced Google Domains DDNS script with In-a-Dyn's own
             plugin.
  - CHANGED: Moved DNSFilter to the LAN section, to make it clear
             that it's unrelated to Trend Micro's engine.
  - CHANGED: Report hostname and IP on Wireless Log page if the
             info is missing from dnsmasq but available from
             networkmap.
  - FIXED: Invalid dnsmasq config when setting DNSFilter to Router
           mode and having IPv6 enabled (themiron).
  - FIXED: client table would be shown twice on the VPN Status
           page if the only connections to an OVPN server
           were invalid clients (like a port scanner)
  - FIXED: DDNS forced updates after "x" days wouldn't be
           initiated.
  - FIXED: CERT VU#598349 vulnerability (DHCP client could
           claim the special "wpad" hostname)
  - REMOVED: Ez-ipupdate DDNS client (replaced with In-a-Dyn).
             Update your scripts if you were relying on it.
  - REMOVED: Norton Safe DNSFilter services (being discontinued
             by Symantec in November).  Configured clients will
             be automatically migrated to OpenDNS Family - make
             sure to edit your DNSFIlter settings if you desire
             to use a different service.


384.6
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_21045/382_50624.
   - NEW: Added support for the "-p" option to netstat.
   - NEW: Added setting to enable DNS rebind protection, on the
          DHCP page.  This works by rejecting upstream server
          responses that would point at a private IP.
   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.8
   - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.60.0 (contains security fixes)
   - CHANGED: Allow selecting text (for copy/paste operations)
              on AiProtection pages.
   - CHANGED: Added AES-*-GCM ciphers to the OpenVPN legacy
              ciphers (so they can be explicitely used without
              using NCP).
   - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.80test2-17-g51e4eee (themiron)
   - CHANGED: Since dnsmasq 2.80, dnsmasq now ensures that unsigned
              DNS replies received with DNSSEC enabled are legitimate.
              If your upstream DNS doesn't support DNSSEC, this means
              all replies from signed zones will be considered
              invalid.  Make sure you only enable DNSSEC if your
              upstream DNS servers do support it.  This behaviour is
              a bit slower, but far more secure than the old default.
   - CHANGED: Network Tools -> Netstat output also report program/PID
   - CHANGED: Updated CA bundle to June 20th version.
   - FIXED: IPv6-related issues on non-HND platform (themiron)
   - FIXED: USB modem support code failing to properly pass
            parameters to the kernel module (themiron)


384.5_3
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_50624
   - FIXED: The SSH authorized keys is stripped/corrupted when
            the router is restored the settings which exported
            from itself.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - No Updates Available.


384.5_2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_50470

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - No Updates Available.


384.5
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - CHANGED: Replaced prebuilt spwenc.o by the source. It causes
              the router being not accessible due to the different
              passwrod encrypt algorithm between each other. Please
              backup the router settings before updating firmware
              across this version.
   - CHANGED: The monthly traffic monitor shows data up to current
              month(M) instead of previous month(M-1).
   - FIXED: The online upgrade feature is broken due to spwenc.o
            source replacement with RTCONFIG_NVRAM_ENCRYPT enabled.
   - FIXED: rstats: take all INTERNET interfaces into account
            instead of only the first one. This fixed the issue
            that there is always no traffic be monitored when only
            the secondary WAN is activated in dual WAN mode.
   - FIXED: Reverted prebuilt wlceventd from RT-N18U GPL 382_39935.
            Asuswrt-Merlin's prebuilt version cannot run in RT-N18U
            because NOTIFICATION_CENTER (which including libnt.so
            and other libraries) option is not enabled on RT-N18U.
   - FIXED: Reverted protect_srv from RT-N18U GPL 382_50276. The
            reason is the same as previous item.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged withh GPL 384_20648
   - NEW: service-event script, executed before any service
           call is made.  First argument is the event (typically
           stop, start or restart), second argument is the target
           (wireless, httpd, etc...).
           Note that this script will block the execution of
           the event until it returns.
   - NEW: Added USB HID modules (for use with devices such
          as UPS)
   - NEW: Added ip6tables-save command.
   - CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.4.6.
   - CHANGED: Updated Dropbear to 2018.76.
   - CHANGED: Updated Openssl to 1.0.2o.
   - CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to version 2.1 (20180508).
   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.5.
   - CHANGED: Moved RT-AC86U to the same Busybox version (1.25.1)
              as other models.
   - CHANGED: Revised OpenVPN server options:
              o Removed "TLS Reneg time" (rarely used, can manually
                be set as a custom option)
              o Removed "Server Poll" (which didn't work
                properly), and reimplemented watchdog service,
                hardcoded to 2 mins frequency.
              o Removed "Push LAN" and "Redirect Gateway",
                replaced with new Client Access setting
              o Removed Firewall setting (firewall rules are now
                always created, and the broken External mode
                was fixed and integrated into the new Client
                Access setting).  You can now use the postconf
                script to override it.
              o Removed option to respond to DNS queries - enabling
                the option to Push DNS will also handle it
              o Added new Client Access setting to select between
                three types of access: LAN only, WAN only (will
                block access to the LAN, including the router
                itself) and LAN + WAN.
              o Keys and certificates can now be up to 7999
                characters long.
   - CHANGED: Revised OpenVPN client options:
              o Reorganized settings into groups
              o Removed "Poll Interval" (which didn't work
                properly), and reimplemented watchdog service,
                with a hardcoded frequency of 2 mins.
              o Removed Firewall setting (firewall rules are now
                always created).  You can now use the postconf
                script to override it.
              o Modified behaviour of Connection Retry.  Instead
                of taking a value in seconds that only affected
                resolution failure, it now takes a number of
                attempts, and affects connection failures.
                Resolution failures will now retry for an infinite
                period of time (the default OpenVPN value).
              o Added "refresh" link which can be clicked to
                re-query the public IP endpoint of the tunnel
              o Keys and certificates can now be up to 7999
                characters long.
   - CHANGED: Removed option to resolve names on the
              Log -> Connections page.
              That functionality was added to the
              Network Tools -> Netstat page instead.
   - CHANGED: Re-designed Log -> Connections page into a table
              with sortable fields - click on a column header to
              sort on that field.
   - CHANGED: From now on, setting the router to act as a master
              browser or a WINS server will also require you to
              enable sharing.  This will ensure that users
              understand that enabling either of these settings
              requires disk sharing to also be enabled (which it
              was already silently doing before).
   - CHANGED: Moved "Beta firmware" option to the Tools -> Other
              Settings page
   - CHANGED: Improved layout of the Firmware Update page
   - CHANGED: WPAD behaviour (sending a carriage return on
              DHCP option 252) can now be controlled in the
              Tweaks section.
   - CHANGED: Blocking custom scripts such as service-event
              and pre-mount will now wait a maximum of 120
              seconds before resuming normal operations, to
              prevent accidental lockouts.
   - CHANGED: Autofill start/end time for DST when selecting
              a timezone (LostFreq)
   - FIXED: Some dnsmasq issues related to DNSSEC were fixed,
            including CVE-2017-15107. (backported from
            dnsmasq 2.79 by John Bacho)
   - FIXED: Restoring an OpenVPN instance to default values
            would fail to disable its Start with WAN setting.
   - FIXED: Minidlna web status page could no longer be enabled.
   - FIXED: CVE-2017-9022, CVE-2017-9023 and CVE-2017-11185 in
            Strongswan (odkrys)
   - FIXED: Various issues with download traffic in Traditional
            QoS (Cédric Dufour)
   - FIXED: TCP timeout values couldn't be changed on the
            Tools -> Other Settings page.
   - FIXED: Security issue related to webui logging in (Asus bug)


384.4_3
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - CHANGED: Replaced prebuilt spwenc.o by the source. It causes
              the router being not accessible due to the different
              passwrod encrypt algorithm between each other. Please
              backup the router settings before updating firmware
              across this version.
   - CHANGED: The monthly traffic monitor shows data up to current
              month(M) instead of previous month(M-1).
   - FIXED: rstats: take all INTERNET interfaces into account
            instead of only the first one. This fixed the issue
            that there is always no traffic be monitored when only
            the secondary WAN is activated in dual WAN mode.
   - FIXED: Reverted prebuilt wlceventd from RT-N18U GPL 382_39935.
            Asuswrt-Merlin's prebuilt version cannot run in RT-N18U
            because NOTIFICATION_CENTER (which including libnt.so
            and other libraries) option is not enabled on RT-N18U.
   - FIXED: Reverted protect_srv from RT-N18U GPL 382_50018. The
            reason is the same as previous item.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - No Updates Available.


384.4_2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - CHANGED: Added visual warning when manually enabling webui
              access on WAN.  Doing so carries serious potential
              security risks, as Asuswrt's web server code should
              not be considered hardened enough for this.
   - FIXED: Security issue in httpd (CVE-2018-8879).
   - FIXED: Potential security issue in httpd related to QiS.
   - FIXED: Minor webui issue in the QoS overhead menu.


384.4
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_50018
   - NOTE: Starting from GPL release 382_50018, NVRAM_ENCRYPT
           option is enabled to enhance the security of nvram.
           Settings stored in nvram will be encrypted after
           upgraded to this version. Downgrade to previous RT-N18U
           firmware will no longer be able to access device and
           must require restore to default by pressing H/W
           reset button. It's recommended to backup the settings
           before upgrading to this version.
   - CHANGED: Simplify the link generation for FAQ 1033906 in VPN
              OpenVPN page.
   - FIXED: Invalid FAQ link of private ip hint and change VPN FAQ
            link as searching 'ASUSWRT VPN' on ASUS website in VPN
            PPTP page.
   - FIXED: Network client count list always shows empty in network
            map page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_20379 (with some binary components
          from 382_50010 and 384_20308 depending on models)
   - NEW: Support the new Entware 64-bit repo on the RT-AC86U.
          To switch to the new repository, re-run the
          entware-setup.sh script.  You will need to reinstall
          your apps (your old config files are backed up on
          your USB disk).
   - CHANGED: Tightened security around some config files.
   - CHANGED: Allow guest networks settings for AP isolation
              and SSID broadcast to be set separately from
              their parent interface (John Bacho)
   - CHANGED: Samba protocol support can now be set to
              SMBv1, SMBv2, or SMBv1 + SMBv2 (the new default).
              This will result in a performance drop on all
              models but the RT-AC86U, but will be more secure.
              Ideally, people should change it to SMBv2 only,
              and then reboot all their client devices to start
              using only the new protocol.
   - CHANGED: Re-added some of the logging sd-idle used to do
              in 380.xx.
   - CHANGED: Switched to the new Entware repo for armv7 models.
              To upgrade, run the following commands TWICE:

              opkg update; opkg upgrade

   - FIXED: Resetting an OpenVPN client to default settings
            might revert back after a reboot.
   - FIXED: log flood from lldpd about "unable to send packet
            on real device" (moved to debug level)
   - FIXED: Potential racing condition that could lead to two
            instances of miniupnpd running at boot time.
   - FIXED: Single-char hostnames were rejected by DHCP static
            leasees page. (theMIROn)
   - FIXED: AiCloud could sometime generate a new SSL certificate
            that would overwrite the one stored in jffs.  Now,
            AiCloud can also use the same one uploaded by the
            user for the main webui, or the Let's Encrypt one.
   - REMOVED: Telnet server.  Please use SSH for console-based
              management.
   - REMOVED: Merlin NAT loopback mode (was increasingly
              problematic as the firmware firewall handling became
              more complex)


384.3
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_39935
   - CHANGED: Hide the 5GHz wireless temperature if the device is
              not supported.
   - FIXED: Wireless LED control does not work on Stealth Mode.
   - FIXED: Duplicate RTCONFIG_WIFI_SON section which is
            mis-merged by Asuswrt-Merlin in nat_setting().
   - FIXED: Hardcode WAN interface as eth0 for Adaptive QoS
            upstream data gathering.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NOTE: AiMesh is currently not supported.  Feasability of
           supporting it is still under evaluation.
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_10007
   - NEW: nano can now be configured through /jffs/configs/nanorc
   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.3.
   - FIXED: Some routers coming from 380.xx would incorrectly
            report a new firmware available at boot time.
   - FIXED: Some broken clients (like Samsung TVs) try to use
            reserved hostnames - ignore these.  (theMIRon)
   - FIXED: Added missing IPv6 local hostnames (theMIRon)
   - FIXED: Issues withh DNS & broadcast relay for pptp
            clients (theMIRon)
   - FIXED: Fixed CVE-2018-5721 in httpd (Merlin & theMIROn)
   - FIXED: helper.js wasn't properly handling parentheses
            (John9527)
   - FIXED: NAT acceleration of PPPoE for some models (fix
            backported from 382_50010)
   - FIXED: Networkmap-related issues on some models (missing
            tx/rx rate and such).
   - FIXED: Network Service Filter wasn't working when in
            Blacklist mode.
   - FIXED: Repeater mode (backport from 384_20287)
