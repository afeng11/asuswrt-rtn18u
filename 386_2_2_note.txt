386.2_2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - FIXED: CPU spike problem caused by mismatching openssl library
           version between libcurl and some AsusWRT prebuilt
           components. This bugfix is a workaround solution by
           downgrading the linking ssl version for curl.
  - CHANGED: Roll back the following prebuilt binaries to the latest
             upstream commit that are using downgraded ssl version:
               - asuswebstorage
               - dropbox_client
               - ftpclient
               - lighttpd-1.4.39 prebuilt modules
  - CHANGED: Revert asusnatnl and wb packages to GPL 382_52288 due
             to the CPU spike problem.
  - REMOVED: jitterentropy-rngd feature. It's an optional feature
             introduced by recent upstream Asuswrt-Merlin.
             We removed it to reduce CPU load.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - No Updates Available.


386.2_1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The upstream Asuswrt-Merlin source tree has been rebased.
          The 386.2_4 and the rebased 386.2_4 are merged by this
          release.
  - CHANGED: Used prebuilt wlconf (from GPL 382_52288) instead of
             compiling form source code due to the rebase changes.
  - CHANGED: Do not create /jffs/wglst file in wget command.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added jitterentropy-rngd to non-HND models, in addition
         to HND models.
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.2.
  - UPDATED: jitterentropy-rngd to 1.2.2 (library 3.0.3)
  - FIXED: OpenVPN server would flip into an error state (being
           shown as "initializing" on the webui) whenever an
           inbound client failed to connect to it.


386.2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NEW: Reimplemented the temperature graph in home page.
         This feature was removed by 386.1 but now add it back.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: due to changes in how custom device icons are handled,
          first time you boot with 386.2 you need to either
          shift-reload the main index page, or clear your
          browser cache.

  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_42095.
  - UPDATED: Openssl to 1.1.1k.
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.1.
  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to March 9th 2021.
  - CHANGED: qos-start "init" user script now runs in blocking
             mode to ensure it's able to complete any changes
             it may apply to qos configs before these
             configs get applied.
  - CHANGED: If dropbear cannot create keys in /jffs then
             create temporary ones in /etc so SSH can work even
             without a working JFFS partition.
  - CHANGED: Enabling DOS protection will now also rate limit
             ICMPV6 echo (type 128) packets, like with IPv4.
  - FIXED: DST not getting applied to some timezones (snauton)
  - FIXED: Traditional QoS was broken in 386.1 (dave14305)
  - FIXED: Userspace conntrack tool was no longer working
  - FIXED: webui incorrectly complaining about mismatched timezone
           between browser and webui for some timezones (dave14305)
  - FIXED: IPv6 pings were blocked if sent below the rate limit
           instead of above (issue introduced in 42095)
  - FIXED: Field that accepted a float value would reject
           values equal to the allowed minimum (for example
           the QoS bandwidth limits)
  - FIXED: QoS Bandwidth settings were hidden on
           non-HND models when accessing the QoS page.
  - REMOVED: SSH Brute Force Protection option (already handled
             by Asuswrt's protect service daemon)
