386.2-beta2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NEW: Reimplemented the temperature graph in home page.
         This feature was removed by 386.1 but now add it back.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: due to changes in how custom device icons are handled,
          first time you boot with 386.2 you need to either
          shift-reload the main index page, or clear your
          browser cache.

  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_42095.
  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.1.
  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to March 9th 2021.
  - CHANGED: qos-start "init" user script now runs in blocking
             mode to ensure it's able to complete any changes
             it may apply to qos configs before these
             configs get applied.
  - CHANGED: If dropbear cannot create keys in /jffs then
             create temporary ones in /etc so SSH can work even
             without a working JFFS partition.
  - FIXED: DST not getting applied to some timezones (snauton)
  - FIXED: Traditional QoS was broken in 386.1 (dave14305)
  - REMOVED: SSH Brute Force Protection option (already handled
             by Asuswrt's protect service daemon)
