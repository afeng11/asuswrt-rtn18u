  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added OpenSSL 1.1.1b in parallel to 1.0.2.  Some services
         like AiCloud are still linked against 1.0.2 because they
         would require Asus to recompile them against 1.1.1.

         Main services that currently use OpenSSL 1.1.1:
         httpd (webui), OpenVPN, wget, net-snmp, Tor, inadyn,
         vsftpd, avahi.

         Models that lack AES acceleration will prioritize the use
         of CHACHA20 over AES-256-GCM, for a small performance
         improvement (for instance with the webui).

         Note that OpenVPN 2.4.7's support is still limited.
         TLS 1.3 is supported, but CHACHA20 support is
         only expected with OpenVPN 2.5.0.

         The 1.0.2 userspace tool is still named "openssl", while
         the 1.1.x version is named "openssl11".

  - NEW: Added DNS Privacy feature, with support for
         DNS-over-TLS (also known as DoT).
         You can configure it on the WAN -> Internet Connection
         page.  You can manually add your own servers, or chose
         one (or a few) from the preset list.  (themiron)
  - NEW: NTP daemon on the router, to allow your LAN clients to
         synchronize their clocks with it.
  - NEW: Option to intercept NTP requests from clients, and
         redirect them to the router's own NTP daemon.
  - NEW: Added service-event-end custom script, executed at the
         end of an rc service call.  Receives the same arguments
         as service-event, but is a non-blocking script.
  - NEW: Added sqlite3 CLI command, to allow script authors to
         create/manage their own sqlite3 database
  - UPDATED: Nano 4.0.
  - UPDATED: Curl 7.64.1.
  - UPDATED: Dropbear 2019.78.
  - CHANGED: Replaced the custom ntpclient with a proper ntpd
             implementation, for reduced memory usage and
             increased accuracy.
  - CHANGED: Made the secondary NTP server configurable through the
             webui.  Note that ntpd will use both servers, so clear
             the second server if there is one and you don't want
             to use it.
  - CHANGED: Re-designed firmware upgrade page, moving the schedule
             option to that page.
  - CHANGED: Removed popup messages showing on the DDNS page when
             a service state change was detected.  Report it within
             the page instead.
  - CHANGED: Report firmware version within the new firmware
             notification popup that appears at the top of the webui.
  - CHANGED: Moved LED control (formerly known as Stealth Mode) to
             the System page.
  - CHANGED: Allow URLs up to 64 chars long on the URL filter.
  - CHANGED: pre-mount user script now receives the filesystem
             as second argument.
  - CHANGED: Moved various DNS-related settings from the DHCP page
             to a more appropriate location on the WAN page.
  - CHANGED: OpenSSL default dir moved to /etc/ssl/.  Allows
             programs to automatically locate the CA bundle
             without requiring explicit configuration.
  - CHANGED: Optimized service restarts generated by the
             System page.
  - CHANGED: Replaced Network Analysis and Netstat pages (under
             Network Tools) with new versions based on Asus's
             Netool daemon (RT-AC86U, RT-N18U)
  - FIXED: CVE-2019-1543 issue with Chacha20-poly1305 in
           OpenSSL 1.1 (themiron)
  - FIXED: Client count on the Sysinfo page was missing
           Guest clients
  - FIXED: Miniupnpd sometimes sending ssdp notifies to
           the wrong interface (themiron)
