384.14
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 385_10002 from asuswrt-merlin.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: wan-event script.  The first parameter will be the WAN unit
         (0 for first WAN, 1 for secondary).  The second parameter
         will be a string describing the type of event (init,
         connected, etc...).  A wan-event of type "connected" will
         be identical to when the original wan-start script was
         being run (wan-start should be considered deprecated
         and will be removed in a future release)
  - NEW: Implemented an official API for addon developers to
         better integrate with the router.  This includes up
         to ten different pages that can be added anywhere within
         the webui, and a dedicated storage repository for your
         settings, which can be interacted with through your
         custom web page or through a shell script.
         See the Wiki for more information:

  - NEW: amtm (Asuswrt-Merlin Terminal Menu) by thelonelycoder has
         been added to the firmware.  Running "amtm" over SSH will
         give you a menu allowing you to select and install various
         addons, such as Diversion (ad blocker) or SKynet (an
         advanced firewall extension).  The plugins for amtm are
         still maintained by its original author (thelonelycoder).
