Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION:
    1. If your device uses stock firmware with version 382_50018
       or later, please downgrade the stock firmware to 382_39935
       or before by using ASUS Firmware Restoration utility
       (https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030652) and then upload
       this firmware via Web UI.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)
       will cause the router being not accessible without
       resetting by hardware button. Please backup the router
       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
       not restore the configuration exported from these versions.

384.7
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: Important changes to DDNS, please read below.

  - NOTE: Important changes to DNSFilter, please read below.

  - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_21152.
  - NEW: Replaced old ez-ipupdate DDNS client with In-a-Dyn.
         A plugin was developed to fully support Asus's DDNS
         service.
         Custom services can now be configured through ddns-start,
         inadyn.conf, inadyn.conf.add or inadyn.postconf.  See the
         In-a-Dyn documentation as many custom services can be
         defined for it.
  - NEW: Added support for freedns.afraid.org DDNS service to webui.
  - NEW: Added option to retrieve WAN IP from either the local
         interface (like before) or through a remote server
         (which works through double NAT) for DDNS.
  - NEW: Added option to disable checks on unsigned DNSSEC replies.
         Disabling these will speed up lookups, but it will also
         remove part of the security benefits of DNSSEC, so it
         should not be used unless you have a very specific reason
         to do so.
  - NEW: Added Quad9 to DNSFilter supported services.
  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.61.1.
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.19.5.
  - CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2p.
  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to v2.80test8 (themiron).
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.1.
  - CHANGED: All DDNS services now use HTTPS.
  - CHANGED: Replaced Google Domains DDNS script with In-a-Dyn's own
             plugin.
  - CHANGED: Moved DNSFilter to the LAN section, to make it clear
             that it's unrelated to Trend Micro's engine.
  - CHANGED: Report hostname and IP on Wireless Log page if the
             info is missing from dnsmasq but available from
             networkmap.
  - FIXED: Invalid dnsmasq config when setting DNSFilter to Router
           mode and having IPv6 enabled (themiron).
  - FIXED: client table would be shown twice on the VPN Status
           page if the only connections to an OVPN server
           were invalid clients (like a port scanner)
  - FIXED: DDNS forced updates after "x" days wouldn't be
           initiated.
  - FIXED: CERT VU#598349 vulnerability (DHCP client could
           claim the special "wpad" hostname)
  - REMOVED: Ez-ipupdate DDNS client (replaced with In-a-Dyn).
             Update your scripts if you were relying on it.
  - REMOVED: Norton Safe DNSFilter services (being discontinued
             by Symantec in November).  Configured clients will
             be automatically migrated to OpenDNS Family - make
             sure to edit your DNSFIlter settings if you desire
             to use a different service.
