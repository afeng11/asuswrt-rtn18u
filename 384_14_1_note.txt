384.14_1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - FIXED: DNS server was unreachable when connecting to an OpenVPN
           server with Advertise DNS enabled, due to firewall rules.
  - FIXED: miniupnpd would reject private WAN IPs - changed that
           upstream behaviour to allow these.
  - FIXED: Would require you to reset the DHCP scope if you
           changed the LAN hostname.
  - FIXED: Couldn't set http mode to http-only if you previously
           had WAN access enabled but have since switched to
           non-router mode.
  - FIXED: CVE-2020-8597 in pppd


384.14
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 385_10002 from asuswrt-merlin.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: wan-event script.  The first parameter will be the WAN unit
         (0 for first WAN, 1 for secondary).  The second parameter
         will be a string describing the type of event (init,
         connected, etc...).  A wan-event of type "connected" will
         be identical to when the original wan-start script was
         being run (wan-start should be considered deprecated
         and will be removed in a future release)
  - NEW: Implemented an official API for addon developers to
         better integrate with the router.  This includes up
         to ten different pages that can be added anywhere within
         the webui, and a dedicated storage repository for your
         settings, which can be interacted with through your
         custom web page or through a shell script.
         See the Wiki for more information:

  - NEW: amtm (Asuswrt-Merlin Terminal Menu) by thelonelycoder has
         been added to the firmware.  Running "amtm" over SSH will
         give you a menu allowing you to select and install various
         addons, such as Diversion (ad blocker) or SKynet (an
         advanced firewall extension).  The plugins for amtm are
         still maintained by its original author (thelonelycoder).

             method.

  - FIXED: Some of the newest DNSFilter servers weren't properly set
           up with IPv6 (dave14305)
