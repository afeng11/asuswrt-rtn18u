Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION:
    1. If your device is running the stock firmware, please
       upgrade to version 3.0.0.4.382.50624 first and then upload
       this firmware via Web UI. Restore to default by hardware
       button is required after the router is switched to
       this firmware.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)
       will cause the router being not accessible without
       resetting by hardware button. Please backup the router
       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
       not restore the configuration exported from these versions.

384.9
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The firmware version is not direct mapping to official
          Asuswrt-Merlin release starting from now since there are
          no available prebuilt binary and no more new features
          introduced for this model in recent codebase.

  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_45149 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: Show the CPU/Wireless temperature in home page.
  - CHANGED: Merge asuswrt-merlin's Tools menu into existing menu:
             - Tools_Sysinfo.asp moved into 'System Log' menu
             - Tools_OtherSettings.asp moved into
               'Administration' menu
  - CHANGED: Update the translation in the wireless site survey
             page.
  - CHANGED: Do not automatically scan site (also disable
             the rescan button) in the wireless site survey page
             when the radio is not enabled.
  - FIXED: The notification flashing interval is not reset after
           checked the firmware update.
  - REMOVED: Temperature page since it's integrated into
             the home page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:

         used by wireless clients for models supporting it

         Thanks to FreshJr for his help in deciphering the packet
         mark values.
  - NEW: Implemented lcp-ident option in PPP (required by some ISPs)
         (Themiron).
  - NEW: You can now choose between having your router do internal
         DNS queries locally (through dnsmasq) or with your WAN
         configured DNS (like stock firmware).  This does not
         affect DNS lookups from your clients, only those made
         by the router itself.  The option is under
         Administration -> Other Settings.  (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.20.
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.2.
  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.64.0.

  - CHANGED: Updated OpenSSL 1.0.x to 1.0.2r.
  - CHANGED: Updated Tor to 0.3.5.8.
  - CHANGED: Updated Chart.js to 2.7.3.
  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.80-44-g608aa9f (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Optimized some JS files to reduce their size
  - CHANGED: OpenVPN clients can now accept CNs up to 255 chars
             when using it to validate the certificate.
  - CHANGED: No longer reset the OpenVPN client's description,
             policy mode and existing rules when uploading an
             .ovpn config file.
  - CHANGED: No longer accept any server-provided route
             when OpenVPN client set to Policy (Strict).
  - CHANGED: Clients bound to DNSFilter rules will no longer
             bypass it by using DoT.  DNSFilter servers that
             support DoT (like Quad9) will only allow filtered
             clients to use that server
  - CHANGED: Re-worked the Classification page.  New design
             is much faster, allows filtering, and shows
             additional info when hovering on a field.
  - CHANGED: Reworked DNS WAN probe implementation (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Increased OpenVPN interface queue length from 100
             to 1000 bytes, to reduce the amount of dropped
             packets if router can't keep up.

           addition to in /jffs
  - FIXED: Couldn't remove an existing OpenVPN key/cert by
           clearing the field on the webui
  - FIXED: Resetting OpenVPN client to Default values wasn't
           removing any existing Extra CA certificate
  - FIXED: Moviestar VLAN routes weren't properly configured
           (broken quagga configuration)
  - FIXED: Missing tooltip content for the new local DNS
           resolution setting on the Tweak page
  - FIXED: OpenVPN CA would be overwritten if there was no
           server key or cert present - only generate them
           if all three are missing.
  - FIXED: Bandwidth Limiter not working properly in some
           cases, as it failed to disable hardware acceleration
  - REMOVED: CFB and OFB ciphers from OpenVPN client
