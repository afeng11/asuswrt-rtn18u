Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION: If your device uses stock firmware with version 382_50018
         or later, please downgrade the stock firmware to 382_39935
         or before by using ASUS Firmware Restoration utility
         (https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030652) and then upload
         this firmware via Web UI.
CAUTION: Upgrade to 384.4_3 from earlier version (<= 384.4_2) will
         cause the router being not accessible without resetting by
         hardware button. Please backup the router settings before
         upgrade the firmware.

384.4_3
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - CHANGED: Replaced prebuilt spwenc.o by the source. It causes
              the router being not accessible due to the different
              passwrod encrypt algorithm between each other. Please
              backup the router settings before updating firmware
              across this version.
   - CHANGED: The monthly traffic monitor shows data up to current
              month(M) instead of previous month(M-1).
   - FIXED: rstats: take all INTERNET interfaces into account
            instead of only the first one. This fixed the issue
            that there is always no traffic be monitored when only
            the secondary WAN is activated in dual WAN mode.
   - FIXED: Reverted prebuilt wlceventd from RT-N18U GPL 382_39935.
            Asuswrt-Merlin's prebuilt version cannot run in RT-N18U
            because NOTIFICATION_CENTER (which including libnt.so
            and other libraries) option is not enabled on RT-N18U.
   - FIXED: Reverted protect_srv from RT-N18U GPL 382_50018. The
            reason is the same as previous item.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - No Updates Available.


384.4_2
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - CHANGED: Added visual warning when manually enabling webui
              access on WAN.  Doing so carries serious potential
              security risks, as Asuswrt's web server code should
              not be considered hardened enough for this.
   - FIXED: Security issue in httpd (CVE-2018-8879).
   - FIXED: Potential security issue in httpd related to QiS.
   - FIXED: Minor webui issue in the QoS overhead menu.


384.4
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_50018
   - NOTE: Starting from GPL release 382_50018, NVRAM_ENCRYPT
           option is enabled to enhance the security of nvram.
           Settings stored in nvram will be encrypted after
           upgraded to this version. Downgrade to previous RT-N18U
           firmware will no longer be able to access device and
           must require restore to default by pressing H/W
           reset button. It's recommended to backup the settings
           before upgrading to this version.
   - CHANGED: Simplify the link generation for FAQ 1033906 in VPN
              OpenVPN page.
   - FIXED: Invalid FAQ link of private ip hint and change VPN FAQ
            link as searching 'ASUSWRT VPN' on ASUS website in VPN
            PPTP page.
   - FIXED: Network client count list always shows empty in network
            map page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_20379 (with some binary components
          from 382_50010 and 384_20308 depending on models)
   - NEW: Support the new Entware 64-bit repo on the RT-AC86U.
          To switch to the new repository, re-run the
          entware-setup.sh script.  You will need to reinstall
          your apps (your old config files are backed up on
          your USB disk).
   - CHANGED: Tightened security around some config files.
   - CHANGED: Allow guest networks settings for AP isolation
              and SSID broadcast to be set separately from
              their parent interface (John Bacho)
   - CHANGED: Samba protocol support can now be set to
              SMBv1, SMBv2, or SMBv1 + SMBv2 (the new default).
              This will result in a performance drop on all
              models but the RT-AC86U, but will be more secure.
              Ideally, people should change it to SMBv2 only,
              and then reboot all their client devices to start
              using only the new protocol.
   - CHANGED: Re-added some of the logging sd-idle used to do
              in 380.xx.
   - CHANGED: Switched to the new Entware repo for armv7 models.
              To upgrade, run the following commands TWICE:

              opkg update; opkg upgrade

   - FIXED: Resetting an OpenVPN client to default settings
            might revert back after a reboot.
   - FIXED: log flood from lldpd about "unable to send packet
            on real device" (moved to debug level)
   - FIXED: Potential racing condition that could lead to two
            instances of miniupnpd running at boot time.
   - FIXED: Single-char hostnames were rejected by DHCP static
            leasees page. (theMIROn)
   - FIXED: AiCloud could sometime generate a new SSL certificate
            that would overwrite the one stored in jffs.  Now,
            AiCloud can also use the same one uploaded by the
            user for the main webui, or the Let's Encrypt one.
   - REMOVED: Telnet server.  Please use SSH for console-based
              management.
   - REMOVED: Merlin NAT loopback mode (was increasingly
              problematic as the firmware firewall handling became
              more complex)
