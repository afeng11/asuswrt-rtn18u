Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION:
    1. If your device uses stock firmware with version 382_50018
       or later, please downgrade the stock firmware to 382_39935
       or before by using ASUS Firmware Restoration utility
       (https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030652) and then upload
       this firmware via Web UI.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)
       will cause the router being not accessible without
       resetting by hardware button. Please backup the router
       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
       not restore the configuration exported from these versions.

384.7-beta1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_21152.
  - NEW: Replaced old ez-ipupdate DDNS client with inadyn.
         A plugin was developed to fully support Asus's DDNS
         service.
         Custom services can now be configured through ddns-start
         inadyn.conf.add, or inadyn.postconf.  See the inadyn
         documentation as many custom services can be defined
         for it.
  - NEW: Added support for freedns.afraid.org DDNS service to webui.
  - NEW: Added option to retrieve WAN IP from either the local
         interface (like before) or through a remote server
         (which works through double NAT) for DDNS.
  - NEW: Added option to disable checks on unsigned DNSSEC replies.
         Disabling these will speed up lookups, but it will also
         remove part of the security benefits of DNSSEC, so it
         should not be used unless you have a very specific reason
         to do so.
  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.61.1.
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.19.5.
  - CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2p.
  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to v2.80test4 (themiron).
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.0 + backported fixes from upstream.
  - CHANGED: All DDNS services now use HTTPS.
  - CHANGED: Replaced Google Domains DDNS script with inadyn's own
             plugin.
  - CHANGED: Moved DNSFilter to the LAN section, to make it clear
             that it's unrelated to Trend Micro's engine.
  - CHANGED: Report hostname and IP on Wireless Log page if the
             info is missing from dnsmasq but available from
             networkmap.
  - FIXED: Invalid dnsmasq config when setting DNSFilter to Router
           mode and having IPv6 enabled (themiron).
  - REMOVED: Ez-ipupdate DDNS client (replaced with inadyn)
