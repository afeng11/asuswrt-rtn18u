Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION:
    1. If your device uses stock firmware with version 382_50018
       or later, please downgrade the stock firmware to 382_39935
       or before by using ASUS Firmware Restoration utility
       (https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030652) and then upload
       this firmware via Web UI.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)
       will cause the router being not accessible without
       resetting by hardware button. Please backup the router
       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
       not restore the configuration exported from these versions.

384.6-beta1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - No Updates Available.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_21045/382_50624.
   - NEW: Added support for the "-p" option to netstat.
   - NEW: Added setting to enable DNS rebind protection, on the
          DHCP page.  This works by rejecting upstream server
          responses that would point at a private IP.
   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.8
   - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.60.0 (contains security fixes)
   - CHANGED: Allow selecting text (for copy/paste operations)
              on AiProtection pages.
   - CHANGED: Added AES-*-GCM ciphers to the OpenVPN legacy
              ciphers (so they can be explicitely used without
              using NCP).
   - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.80test2-17-g51e4eee (themiron)
   - CHANGED: Since dnsmasq 2.80, dnsmasq now ensures that unsigned
              DNS replies received with DNSSEC enabled are legitimate.
              If your upstream DNS doesn't support DNSSEC, this means
              all replies from signed zones will be considered
              invalid.  Make sure you only enable DNSSEC if your
              upstream DNS servers do support it.  This behaviour is
              a bit slower, but far more secure than the old default.
   - CHANGED: Network Tools -> Netstat output also report program/PID
   - CHANGED: Updated CA bundle to June 20th version.
   - FIXED: IPv6-related issues on non-HND platform (themiron)
   - FIXED: USB modem support code failing to properly pass
            parameters to the kernel module (themiron)
