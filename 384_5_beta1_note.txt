CAUTION: Upgrade to 384.5-beta1 from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)

         settings before upgrade the firmware.

384.5-beta1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - CHANGED: Replaced prebuilt spwenc.o by the source. It causes
              the router being not accessible due to the different
              passwrod encrypt algorithm between each other. Please
              backup the router settings before updating firmware
              across this version.(backport to 384.4_3)
   - CHANGED: The monthly traffic monitor shows data up to current
              month(M) instead of previous month(M-1).
              (backport to 384.4_3)
   - FIXED: rstats: take all INTERNET interfaces into account
            instead of only the first one. This fixed the issue
            that there is always no traffic be monitored when only
            the secondary WAN is activated in dual WAN mode.
            (backport to 384.4_3)
   - FIXED: Reverted prebuilt wlceventd from RT-N18U GPL 382_39935.
            Asuswrt-Merlin's prebuilt version cannot run in RT-N18U
            because NOTIFICATION_CENTER (which including libnt.so
            and other libraries) option is not enabled on RT-N18U.
            (backport to 384.4_3)
   - FIXED: Reverted protect_srv from RT-N18U GPL 382_50276. The
            reason is the same as previous item.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged withh GPL 384_20648
   - NEW: service-event script, executed before any service
           call is made.  First argument is the event (typically
           stop, start or restart), second argument is the target
           (wireless, httpd, etc...).
           Note that this script will block the execution of
           the event until it returns.
   - CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.4.6.
   - CHANGED: Updated Dropbear to 2018.76.
   - CHANGED: Updated Openssl to 1.0.2o.
   - CHANGED: Updated miniupnpd to 20180412.
   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.5.
   - CHANGED: Revised OpenVPN server options:
              o Removed "TLS Reneg time" (rarely used, can manually
                be set as a custom option)
              o Removed "Server Poll" (which didn't work
                properly), and reimplemented watchdog service,
                hardcoded to 2 mins frequency.
              o Removed "Push LAN" and "Redirect Gateway",
                replaced with new Client Access setting
              o Removed Firewall setting (firewall rules are now
                always created, and the broken External mode
                was fixed and integrated into the new Client
                Access setting).  You can now use the postconf
                script to override it.
              o Removed option to respond to DNS queries - enabling
                the option to Push DNS will also handle it
              o Added new Client Access setting to select between
                three types of access: LAN only, WAN only (will
                block access to the LAN, including the router
                itself) and LAN + WAN.
              o Keys and certificates can now be up to 7999
                characters long.
   - CHANGED: Revised OpenVPN client options:
              o Reorganized settings into groups
              o Removed "Poll Interval" (which didn't work
                properly), and reimplemented watchdog service,
                with a hardcoded frequency of 2 mins.
              o Removed Firewall setting (firewall rules are now
                always created).  You can now use the postconf
                script to override it.
              o Modified behaviour of Connection Retry.  Instead
                of taking a value in seconds that only affected
                resolution failure, it now takes a number of
                attempts, and affects connection failures.
                Resolution failures will now retry for an infinite
                period of time (the default OpenVPN value).
              o Added "refresh" link which can be clicked to
                re-query the public IP endpoint of the tunnel
              o Keys and certificates can now be up to 7999
                characters long.
   - CHANGED: Removed option to resolve names on the
              Log -> Connections page (making that page work
              now like on stock Asus firmware).
              That functionality is now provided by the
              Network Tools -> Netstat page.
   - CHANGED: Re-designed Log -> Connections page into a table
              with sortable fields.
   - CHANGED: From now on, setting the router to act as a master
              browser or a WINS server will also require you to
              enable sharing.  This will ensure that disks won't
              be accidentally shared when sharing is disabled
              but you had one of these two options enabled.
   - CHANGED: Moved "Beta firmware" option to the Tools -> Other
              Settings page
   - CHANGED: Improved layout of the Firmware Update page
   - CHANGED: DHCP server no longer sends an empty DHCP
              option 252 (for WPAD), Windows should now
              behave correctly without these.
   - CHANGED: Blocking custom scripts such as service-event
              and pre-mount will now wait a maximum of 120
              seconds before resuming normal operations, to
              prevent accidental lockouts.
   - FIXED: Some dnsmasq issues related to DNSSEC were fixed,
            including CVE-2017-15107. (backported from
            dnsmasq 2.79 by John Bacho)
   - FIXED: Restoring an OpenVPN instance to default values
            would fail to disable its Start with WAN setting.
   - FIXED: Minidlna web status page could no longer be enabled.
