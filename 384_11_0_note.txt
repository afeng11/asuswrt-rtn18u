  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NOTE: The project now has its own domain name.  Official website
          is now https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/ and my email address
          for anything related to the project is now
          merlin@asuswrt-merlin.net.

  - NEW: Added WS-Discovery support.  This allows Windows clients
         to detect the router's shared USB drives even if SMBv1
         support is disabled.
  - NEW: Re-added option to extend the WAN's TTL (from stock
         firmware, was previously disabled as it used to
         be broken)
  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 384_45717
  - UPDATED: Nano 4.2.
  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-11 to 1.1.1c.
  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-10 to 1.0.2s.
  - UPDATED: curl 7.65.1.
  - UPDATED: miniupnpd 20190604.
  - CHANGED: Local clients will be shown by their hostname
             on the Classification page.
  - CHANGED: Reworked handling of up/down events in OpenVPN.
             Server instance will now also use its own
             updown script, which will handle firing up
             openvpn-event (if present).
  - CHANGED: Inbound traffic sent to you through an OpenVPN client
             will now be dropped by default.  This can be changed
             through the new "Inbound Firewall" parameter found
             on the OpenVPN client page.  You should only change
             this to "Allow" if running a site2site tunnel with
             a trusted remote server, or if you do expect
             traffic to be forwarded to you through the tunnel.
  - CHANGED: The router will now use ISP-provided resolvers
             instead of local dnsmasq when attempting to
             resolve addresses, for improved reliability.
             This reproduces how stock firmware behaves.
             This only affects name resolution done
             by the router itself, not by the LAN clients.
             The behaviour can still be changed on the
             Administration -> Other Settings page.
  - CHANGED: Randomize the serial number of certificates
             generated by the router for its httpd.  If
             using a router-generated certificate, then
             it's recommended to generate a new one.
  - CHANGED: Allow USB idle values up to 9999.
  - CHANGED: Reworked how some services are started when the WAN
             interface comes up to prevent deadlocks between
             the WAN completing its initialisation, and the
             clock getting set.  These could result is fairly
             long boot time for some ISPs.
  - FIXED: openvpn-event script not launching if the
           client was configured in Secret Key auth
           mode.
  - FIXED: Page redirection failing to apply at boot
           time if WAN was down.
  - FIXED: CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478 and
           CVE-2019-11479 (themiron)
