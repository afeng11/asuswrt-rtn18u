Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
   NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.
CAUTION:
    1. If your device is running the stock firmware, please
       upgrade to version 3.0.0.4.382.50624 first and then upload
       this firmware via Web UI. Restore to default by hardware
       button is required after the router is switched to
       this firmware.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)
       will cause the router being not accessible without
       resetting by hardware button. Please backup the router
       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
       not restore the configuration exported from these versions.

384.9-beta1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The firmware version is not direct mapping to official
          Asuswrt-Merlin release starting from now since there are
          no available prebuilt binary and no more new features
          introduced for this model in the recent codebase.

  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_45149 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: Show the CPU/Wireless temperature in home page.
  - CHANGED: Merge asuswrt-merlin's Tools menu into existing menu:
             - Tools_Sysinfo.asp moved into 'System Log' menu
             - Tools_OtherSettings.asp moved into
               'Administration' menu
  - CHANGED: Remove the Temperature page since it's integrated
             into the home page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Report the number of spatial streams and the PHY type
         used by wireless clients for models supporting it
  - NEW: Display tracked connections on the QoS Stats page (now
         relabeled "Classification").
         Fields can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.
         Thanks to FreshJr for his help in deciphering the packet
         mark values.
  - NEW: Implemented ipsec.postconf and strongswan.postconf scripts.
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.20.
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.2.
  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.62.0.
  - CHANGED: Updated Chart.js to 2.7.3.
  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.80-32-g28cfe36 (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Optimized some JS files to reduce their size
  - CHANGED: OpenVPN clients can now accept CNs up to 255 chars
             when using it to validate the certificate.
  - CHANGED: No longer reset the OpenVPN client's description,
             policy mode and existing rules when uploading an
             .ovpn config file.
  - CHANGED: No longer accept any server-provided route
             when OpenVPN client set to Policy (Strict).
  - CHANGED: Clients bound to DNSFilter rules will no longer
             bypass it by using DoT.  DNSFilter servers that
             support DoT (like Quad9) will only allow filtered
             clients to use that server
  - FIXED: DNSFilter clients could use a different nameserver
           when using an IPv6 connection
