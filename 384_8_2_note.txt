    1. If your device uses stock firmware with version 382_50018
       or later, please downgrade the stock firmware to 382_39935
       or earlier version by using ASUS Firmware Restoration
       utility (https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030652) and then
       upload this firmware via Web UI.
    2. Upgrade to this firmware from earlier version (<= 384.4_2)

       settings before upgrade the firmware.
    3. The online upgrade feature is broken between 384.4_3 and
       384.5-beta2 due to spwenc.o source replacement. Please do
