  - NEW: Added captcha feature support.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
  - NEW: Added support for static routes for PPTP/L2TP VPN
         clients, on the Static Route page (themiron)
  - NEW: Added notification when JFFS free space drops
         below 3 MB.
  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.82-openssl (themiron)
  - CHANGED: Rewrote a large portion of the OpenVPN implementation,
             to make the code easier to maintain.  The new libovpn
             code is released under a GPL licence.  Functionality
             should largely remain the same.
  - CHANGED: Replaced updown-*.sh OpenVPN event handler scripts
             with binary libovpn functions. The new code does
             stricter validation of the configuration.
  - CHANGED: Enabling Client Config Dir (ccd) for an OpenVPN
             server in non-exclusive mode will no longer accept
             duplicate common names (to prevent issues with
             two clients trying to share the same settings).
             If you need such an unusual setup, you should
             enable "Username/Password auth only", which will
             make the common name become the username.  Or
             better, ensure that you have unique certificates
             for all of your users.
  - CHANGED: Removed the (undocumented) vpn_debug setting.  Debug
             logging will now only come from OpenVPN itself
             (configurable through the log verbosity setting).
  - CHANGED: Improved mechanism for providing an available
             mount point for addon API scripters (dave14305)
  - CHANGED: Harmonized the various SSL certificate modes with
             upstream.
             0-None - will be self-generated
             1-Imported - lets you upload your own (no longer
                           self generated unless you don't
                           upload one)
            2-Let's Encrypt (unchanged)
            Self-generated cert will be stored to /jffs/cert.tgz,
            just like upstream.
  - FIXED: ddns updates and OpenVPN instances might be launched
           twice at boot time if the initial ntp clock sync
           happened too fast.
  - FIXED: Enforced DNS and tQoS fix would be lost when the
           firewall gets restarted while an OpenVPN client
           is running.
  - FIXED: Various issues surrounding error state report
           when an OpenVPN client failed to start properly.
  - FIXED: WINS provided by an OpenVPN server weren't properly
           used.
  - FIXED: Some large DNS queries could fail when using DoT
           (patch backported from upstream)
