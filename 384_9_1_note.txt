384.9
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
  - NOTE: The firmware version is not direct mapping to official
          Asuswrt-Merlin release starting from now since there are
          no available prebuilt binary and no more new features
          introduced for this model in recent codebase.

  - NEW: Merge GPL 384_45149 from asuswrt-merlin.
  - NEW: Show the CPU/Wireless temperature in home page.
  - CHANGED: Merge asuswrt-merlin's Tools menu into existing menu:
             - Tools_Sysinfo.asp moved into 'System Log' menu
             - Tools_OtherSettings.asp moved into
               'Administration' menu
  - CHANGED: Update the translation in the wireless site survey
             page.
  - CHANGED: Do not automatically scan site (also disable
             the rescan button) in the wireless site survey page
             when the radio is not enabled.
  - FIXED: The notification flashing interval is not reset after
           checked the firmware update.

         Thanks to FreshJr for his help in deciphering the packet
         mark values.
  - NEW: Implemented lcp-ident option in PPP (required by some ISPs)
         (Themiron).
  - NEW: You can now choose between having your router do internal
         DNS queries locally (through dnsmasq) or with your WAN
         configured DNS (like stock firmware).  This does not
         affect DNS lookups from your clients, only those made
         by the router itself.  The option is under
         Administration -> Other Settings.  (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.20.
  - CHANGED: Updated nano to 3.2.

             .ovpn config file.
  - CHANGED: No longer accept any server-provided route
             when OpenVPN client set to Policy (Strict).
  - CHANGED: Clients bound to DNSFilter rules will no longer
             bypass it by using DoT.  DNSFilter servers that
             support DoT (like Quad9) will only allow filtered
             clients to use that server
  - CHANGED: Re-worked the Classification page.  New design

             additional info when hovering on a field.
  - CHANGED: Reworked DNS WAN probe implementation (Themiron)
  - CHANGED: Increased OpenVPN interface queue length from 100

  - FIXED: Couldn't remove an existing OpenVPN key/cert by
           clearing the field on the webui
  - FIXED: Resetting OpenVPN client to Default values wasn't
           removing any existing Extra CA certificate

           (broken quagga configuration)
  - FIXED: Missing tooltip content for the new local DNS
           resolution setting on the Tweak page
  - FIXED: OpenVPN CA would be overwritten if there was no
           server key or cert present - only generate them
           if all three are missing.

           cases, as it failed to disable hardware acceleration
