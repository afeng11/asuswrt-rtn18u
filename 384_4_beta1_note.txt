Asuswrt-Merlin for RT-N18U Release Note
===================================================================
  NOTE: RT-N18U IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Asuswrt-Merlin.

384.4-beta1
  Changelog for RT-N18U:
   - NEW: Merged RT-N18U GPL release 382_50018
   - NOTE: Starting from GPL release 382_50018, NVRAM_ENCRYPT
           option is enabled to enhance the security of nvram.
           Settings stored in nvram will be encrypted after
           upgraded to this version. Downgrade to previous RT-N18U
           firmware will no longer be able to access device and
           must require restore to default by pressing H/W
           reset button. It's recommended to backup the settings
           before upgrading to this version.
   - FIXED: Network client count list always shows empty in network
            map page.

  Changelog from Asuswrt-Merlin:
   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_20379 (with some binary components
          from 382_50010 and 384_20308 depending on models)
   - CHANGED: Tightened security around some config files.
   - CHANGED: Allow guest networks settings for AP isolation
              and SSID broadcast to be set separately from
              their parent interface (John Bacho)
   - CHANGED: Samba protocol support can now be set to
              SMBv1, SMBv2, or SMBv1 + SMBv2 (the new default).
              This will result in a performance drop on all
              models but the RT-AC86U, but will be more secure.
              Ideally, people should change it to SMBv2 only,
              and then reboot all their client devices to start
              using only the new protocol.
   - FIXED: Resetting an OpenVPN client to default settings
            might revert back after a reboot.
   - FIXED: log flood from lldpd about "unable to send packet
            on real device" (moved to debug level)
   - REMOVED: Telnet server.  Please use SSH for console-based
              management.
